# HTML-CSS-JS-course-in-Coursera
This repo contains my assignments in the course "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" of Johns Hopkins University in Coursera.

All of the assignments in this repo is not graded yet, since I only enroll the free one, which doesn't provide any certificates. 

Anyway, it is a pleasure for me if you spend time to take a look and grade these assignments. Feel free to critize :)
